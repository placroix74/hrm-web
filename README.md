# HRM-WEB
An interactive, browser-based [Human Resource Machine](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine) simulator.

## Why?
The game did not come with [a level editor](https://steamcommunity.com/app/375820/discussions/0/351659808488235380/).

## Prior Art
- https://github.com/ymizushi/hrm-js : non-interactive(?), Node.js-based

## Features
- Everything on _one page_ : software and help text.
- Levels load from a JSON file.
  - Every level from the original game included. (Is this legal?)

## Installation
1) [Download the current master](https://github.com/placroix74/hrm-web/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
1) Extract.
1) Open `hrm-web.html` in your favorite browser

## Tech
